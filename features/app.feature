#Feature: Generate skellington

#  Scenario: generate app file
#    When I successfully run `skellington generate dummy_gem`
#    Then a directory named "dummy_gem/lib/" should exist
#    And a file named "dummy_gem/lib/dummy_gem.rb" should exist
#    And the file "dummy_gem/lib/dummy_gem.rb" should contain:
#    """
#    """
# Template *should* be a class
