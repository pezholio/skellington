Your new Sinatra app <%= @gen.camelname %> has been created

<% if @gen.renamed %>
(Note that '<%= @gen.filename %>' has been changed to '<%= @gen.wormname %>' because Ruby gets confused by '-'s)

<% end %>
Now do

    cd <%= @gen.wormname %>
    bundle
    rake

And presuming that passes OK

    git add .
    git commit -m 'First commit'

You can run the app with

    rackup
